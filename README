Simple support for executing JDave (http://www.jdave.org/) specs written in Scala
with sbt (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/). 

1) ./sbt clean package
2) Copy target/jdave-sbt-<version>.jar into project/build/lib directory
   of your sbt project.
3) Override testFrameworks in your project definition to include jdave support:

    override def testFrameworks = sbt.SpecsFramework :: jdave.sbt.JDaveFramework :: Nil
